Led-Matrix-8x16
This project demonstrates how to control an 8x16 LED matrix using an Arduino Uno. The LED matrix displays characters, strings, and a counter using I2C communication.

Hardware Requirements
Arduino Uno
Keyestudio 8x16 LED Matrix
Jumper wires
Libraries
No external libraries are required for this project. All necessary functions are included in the provided code.

Pin Connections
Connect the LED matrix to the Arduino as follows:

SCL (Clock) -> Arduino pin 3
SDA (Data) -> Arduino pin 4
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Led-Matrix-8x16.git
Open the Led-Matrix-8x16.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Connect your Arduino Uno to your computer.
Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
Usage
Initializing the LED Matrix
Before using the LED matrix, you need to initialize it with the led_matrix_init function, specifying the I2C pins:

cpp
Copy code
led_matrix_init(3, 4);
Displaying Characters and Strings
To display a single character, use the add_char function.
To display a string, use the str_array and write_str functions.
Example:

cpp
Copy code
unsigned char value[256];
int k = 0;
str_array("Hello", value, &k);
write_str(value, &k);
Counter
You can display a counting sequence on the LED matrix using the Counter function:

cpp
Copy code
unsigned char char_tuple[256];
Counter(10, char_tuple, 1000, true);  // Count down from 10
Counter(10, char_tuple, 1000, false); // Count up to 10
Clear Display
To clear the display, use the clear8x16 function:

cpp
Copy code
clear8x16();
Functions
IIC_start(): Initiates the I2C communication.
IIC_send(unsigned char send_data): Sends data over I2C.
IIC_end(): Ends the I2C communication.
set_address(): Sets the address for the LED matrix.
set_brightness(): Sets the brightness of the LED matrix.
choose_value(char character): Chooses the bitmap value for a character.
add_char(unsigned char value[], int *k, unsigned char selection): Adds a character bitmap to the value array.
clear8x16(): Clears the LED matrix display.
str_array(unsigned char *str, unsigned char value[], int *k): Converts a string to an array of character bitmaps.
write_str(unsigned char value[], int *k): Writes the string to the LED matrix display.
write_location(unsigned char value[], int *k): Writes the string to a specific location on the LED matrix display.
Counter(int num, unsigned char char_tuple[], int time, bool UpOrDown): Displays a counter on the LED matrix display.
