**Led-Matrix-8x16**

This project demonstrates how to control an 8x16 LED matrix using an Arduino Uno. The LED matrix displays characters, strings, and a counter using I2C communication.

**Hardware Requirements**

- Arduino Uno
- Keyestudio 8x16 LED Matrix
- Jumper wires

**Libraries**

No external libraries are required for this project. All necessary functions are included in the provided code.

**Pin Connections**

Connect the LED matrix to the Arduino as follows:

- SCL (Clock) -> Arduino pin 3
- SDA (Data) -> Arduino pin 4

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

    https://github.com/your-username/Led-Matrix-8x16.git

1. Open the Led-Matrix-8x16.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
1. Connect your Arduino Uno to your computer.
1. Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
1. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.

**Usage**

**Initializing the LED Matrix**

Before using the LED matrix, you need to initialize it with the led\_matrix\_init function, specifying the I2C pins:

led\_matrix\_init(3, 4);

**Displaying Characters and Strings**

- To display a single character, use the add\_char function.
- To display a string, use the str\_array and write\_str functions.

Example:

unsigned char value[256];

int k = 0;

str\_array("Hello", value, &k);

write\_str(value, &k);

**Counter**

You can display a counting sequence on the LED matrix using the Counter function:


unsigned char char\_tuple[256];

Counter(10, char\_tuple, 1000, true);  // Count down from 10

Counter(10, char\_tuple, 1000, false); // Count up to 10

**Clear Display**

To clear the display, use the clear8x16 function:

clear8x16();

**Functions**

- IIC\_start(): Initiates the I2C communication.
- IIC\_send(unsigned char send\_data): Sends data over I2C.
- IIC\_end(): Ends the I2C communication.
- set\_address(): Sets the address for the LED matrix.
- set\_brightness(): Sets the brightness of the LED matrix.
- choose\_value(char character): Chooses the bitmap value for a character.
- add\_char(unsigned char value[], int \*k, unsigned char selection): Adds a character bitmap to the value array.
- clear8x16(): Clears the LED matrix display.
- str\_array(unsigned char \*str, unsigned char value[], int \*k): Converts a string to an array of character bitmaps.
- write\_str(unsigned char value[], int \*k): Writes the string to the LED matrix display.
- write\_location(unsigned char value[], int \*k): Writes the string to a specific location on the LED matrix display.
- Counter(int num, unsigned char char\_tuple[], int time, bool UpOrDown): Displays a counter on the LED matrix display.
